# ecs-arraybuffer
Playground to get a simple automated game to work efficiently.  Starting with a simple entity system that just loops through and updates each entity once per frame.  Next, going to write the same game with an ECS framework.  Lastly, I want to either find or write a basic ECS framework which is backed by SharedArrayBuffer's so we can crank up the number of ships/stations while keeping a consistent framerate.
